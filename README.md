## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.org/) - Module bundler
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/recipes/recipes) - React state management
- [animateCSS](https://animate.style) - Simple CSS animations

### What I learned

We learnt basic TailwindCSS which helped us speed up the process of styling a website. I'll continue to use it for bigger applications. I also learnt a react state management library called Zustand, and it was very simple and useful. I mainly used this project to strenghten my React knowledge.

### Continued development
We're planning on learning Nextjs and then coming together to collab on another frontend mentor challenge with Nextjs.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS crash course by Tailwind Labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5f_mz_zU5eXWYDXHUDOLBE0scnuJofO0) - This helped me get up and running with Tailwind CSS. I really liked the simplicity of these videos and I found them very useful.

- [Zustand simple tutorial](https://youtu.be/jLcF0Az1nx8) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me learn the basics of Zustand or React state management in General. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept, especially because it's easier than Redux.
